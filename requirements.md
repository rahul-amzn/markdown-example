I want to build a serverless AI agent application for personalized Stock analysis 

**1. Requirement Analysis**

- Define core functionalities:
    - Pull stock prices and news (use dummy data sources initially).
    - Analyze data using Claude AI model via Amazon Bedrock.
    - Send personalized daily insights via email.
    - Implement subscription management with subscribe/unsubscribe flows.
    - Store subscription details in DynamoDB.
    - Automate infrastructure deployment via Terraform.
- Identify user interaction points:
    - Frontend React app for subscription management.
- Define scheduling mechanism for daily notifications using EventBridge.

**2. System Design**

- Architecture:
    - Frontend: React app interfacing with API Gateway.
    - Backend: AWS Lambda functions (Python) for processing user inputs and invoking Claude model.
    - Data Storage: DynamoDB for subscription details.
    - AI Integration: Claude model accessed through Amazon Bedrock.
    - Scheduling: EventBridge to trigger daily Lambda for sending insights.
    - Infrastructure as Code: Terraform scripts for provisioning all AWS resources.
- Data Flow:
    - User subscribes/unsubscribes via React → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB.
    - Scheduled Lambda fetches stock data/news (dummy), invokes Claude for analysis, sends emails.
- Security \& Compliance:
    - Secure API endpoints.
    - Manage unsubscribe flow to comply with email regulations.

**3. Implementation**

- Develop React frontend with forms for subscription/un-subscription.
- Implement Lambda functions in Python:
    - Handler for subscription management.
    - Handler for scheduled daily insight generation.
- Integrate Lambda with Amazon Bedrock to call Claude model.
- Use dummy stock price/news data sources during development.
- Write Terraform scripts to provision:
    - API Gateway
    - Lambda functions
    - DynamoDB tables
    - EventBridge rules
    - IAM roles and permissions

**4. Testing**

- Unit test Lambda functions locally and in AWS.
- End-to-end tests for subscription flow via API Gateway and React frontend.
- Test scheduled daily insight delivery with dummy data.
- Validate unsubscribe functionality and data persistence in DynamoDB.
- Load and scalability testing for concurrent subscriptions and notifications.

**5. Deployment**

- Use Terraform to deploy infrastructure to AWS.
- Deploy Lambda functions and configure triggers.
- Set up EventBridge rule for daily scheduled Lambda invocation.
- Monitor deployment logs and metrics for issues.

**6. Maintenance**

- Monitor system health and logs.
- Update AI model integration as needed.
- Enhance data sources from dummy to real APIs.
- Manage subscription database and email delivery compliance.
- Iterate on features based on user feedback.
